				<h2> The White Tailed Deer</h2>
				<p>White tailed deer are the most abundant species of large herbivores in North America<br>
				They got their name because their butt is white with a tiny black tip on their tail.<br>
				White Tailed Deer are the most hunted out of the 5 types of Deer. Reason for this<br>
				is most likely due to their population and how tasty they are!</p>
